# Design Patterns using Python
An attempt to capture my learnings of design pattern .

### Resources:-
1. HeadFirst Design Patterns Book :
   I really liked the style of this book. The conversational style keeps the book within reach of someone who is learning Design Patterns for the first time. I have come across it before but never understood it well enough to use it. This book has a style of teaching like the way I would enjoy it in a class.
   
2. https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns  : 
I found this website to be a great add-on to my book learning. This shows a good python example and a brief introduction on each strategy. I hope to make use of it in future as well.


### My Learnings so far
05/24/2019
1. I think my design skill has been below average so far (and it is 2019 for God's sake). I think because I take time to learn, because I need space to learn, because I need to take a step back from the rush of daily office work, I wasn't really able to appreciate it as much before. Never had the time and clarity of learning it. This time I do have it (out of force if I can be honest) but I am glad I am doing it. Hopefully I will be able to keep the momentum going.

2. My Goal from this exercise is, do the first five chapter of the book and really really get a clarity on how it works. How the nuts and bolts of a design pattern fit together in general. The goal is definitely NOT to learn all the patterns but more on how to think in terms of Pattern. So I am not going to blast through the rest of patterns from Chapter 6. Instead, once I have covered till Ch-5, I plan to pick up Open Source Projects and contribute there. I dont think there will be any better way to learn a real life coding/designing OOP code than this. Keeping myself close of fundamentals has always helped me in past. I do well if I know the basics and then I can build on top of that. I must say that the rush mentality of Agile community is something I struggle with. I dont know. I am hopeful that I will get better at it with time.
