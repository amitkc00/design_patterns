# Design Patterns using Python
An attempt to capture my learnings of design pattern .

### Resources:-
1. HeadFirst Design Patterns Book :
   I really liked the style of this book. The conversational style keeps the book within reach of someone who is learning Design Patterns for the first time. I have come across it before but never understood it well enough to use it. This book has a style of teaching like the way I would enjoy it in a class.
   
2. https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns  : 
I found this website to be a great add-on to my book learning. This shows a good python example and a brief introduction on each strategy. I hope to make use of it in future as well.


### My Learnings so far
05/24/2019
1. I think my design skill has been below average so far (and it is 2019 for God's sake). I think because I take time to learn, because I need space to learn, because I need to take a step back from the rush of daily office work, I wasn't really able to appreciate it as much before. Never had the time and clarity of learning it. This time I do have it (out of force if I can be honest) but I am glad I am doing it. Hopefully I will be able to keep the momentum going.

2. My Goal from this exercise is, do the first five chapter of the book and really really get a clarity on how it works. How the nuts and bolts of a design pattern fit together in general. The goal is definitely NOT to learn all the patterns but more on how to think in terms of Pattern. So I am not going to blast through the rest of patterns from Chapter 6. Instead, once I have covered till Ch-5, I plan to pick up Open Source Projects and contribute there. I dont think there will be any better way to learn a real life coding/designing OOP code than this. Keeping myself close of fundamentals has always helped me in past. I do well if I know the basics and then I can build on top of that. I must say that the rush mentality of Agile community is something I struggle with. I dont know. I am hopeful that I will get better at it with time.

3. The other mistake I could count on that lead to my poor design skill is/are:-
a. Most interviews focus on asking interviewers questions on Data Structures/Algorithms or Fact based information like tell me what does this output of TOP shows. Explain all the fields. Explain how DNS lookup works, Explain how would you debug a error and others. So much so that to me it felt like a norm. It felt like these are the topics that I need to focus on. I did get questions on design I would say total of 3 times in my last 5 years of giving 50+ interviews and I did horrible. Now if I was able to do decent in 47 ones without doing any design, chances are I am going to not priotize Design for my 51st interview as well. But the reality strikes when you have to do greenfield projects. Projects for which there's no clear path laid out and you have to do all the fresh thinking on your own. I have failed in such cirumstance but I failed to realize that the reasons for them until now. What I realize is that, you have to spend great deal of time thinking about new problems and how to solve them. You have to look at Open Source Projects and contribute selflessley. There's no monitary reward for the effort but there's a free-mind exploration of being able to do something just for fun.
